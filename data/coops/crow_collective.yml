  en: '<p>CROW (Cycle Courier Collective) is a group of independent (cargo)bike couriers and bike geeks. Displeased with the current conditions for couriers in Berlin, namely the (self)exploitation of couriers'' labour, we decided to forge our own path instead of joining another company. CROW is based on a few very simple principles:<ul><li>We want fair pay for the hard and important work that we provide - making fair and sustainable services financially accessible, without exploiting ourselves and dumping our prices.</li><li>We want to work with people who take sustainable business practices and fair working conditions into their own work and act responsibly - solidarity is key!.</li><li>To work as emission-free and sustainable as possible; this is why we are completely car-free and pedal-powered.</li><li>Organize, share a collective mindset, go as DIY as possible, be friends and support each other with different projects</li><li>Create a community; we hope to foster a loving and supportive community around the bicycle, not only for couriers but for all those who are passionate about bikes</li><li>Get politically and socially involved, propelling a bike supported revolution</li><li>All Couriers Are Beautiful and All Crows Are Birds</li><li>No Gods, No Masters, No Border, No Nation</ul>Today, CROW is entirely comprised of cargo bikes, and we are always eager to take on any logistics challenge, regardless of weight or size. We are capable of transporting goods up to 150kg in weight, providing stocking solutions and decentralised distribution, all powered by CoopCycle.</p>'
  fr: 'Collectif de Coursier.e.s Cargo CROW s''est fondé d''un groupe de coursier.e.s independant.e.s et des malades du vélo. Voyant la situation d''(auto-)exploitation des coursier.e.s à Berlin, nous avons decidé.e.s à suivre notre propre chemin à la place de joindre une autre entreprise. En collectif on se bat contre les prix bas, visant un paiement adéquat aux risques et importance de notre travail. On transporte l''esprit DIY et un approche anti-autoritaire avec notre travail en collectif. Nous sommes forcément politisé.e.s et nous poursuivons la révolution par le vélo. '
